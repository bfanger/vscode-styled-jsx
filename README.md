# vscode-styled-plugin-jsx

SCSS Syntax highlighting for [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) with the [styled-jsx-plugin-sass](https://github.com/giuseppeg/styled-jsx-plugin-sass) enabled.

Recommended to also install the extension [styled-jsx Language Server (scss)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.vscode-styled-jsx-languageserver-scss)
This adds property completion, color picker, etc.

This extension is a fork of [vscode-styled-jsx](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blanu.vscode-styled-jsx) but instead of css uses scss systax (forked from [atom's language-sass](https://github.com/atom/language-sass/)
